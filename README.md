# CQ Groovy Console

[CITYTECH, Inc.](http://www.citytechinc.com)

## Overview

The CQ Groovy Console provides an interface for running [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) scripts in the Adobe CQ5
container.  Scripts can be created to manipulate content in the JCR, call OSGi services, or execute arbitrary code using
the CQ, Sling, or JCR APIs.  After installing the package in CQ5 (instructions below), see the
[console page](http://localhost:4502/groovyconsole) for documentation on the available bindings and methods.  Sample
scripts are included in the package for reference.

See the [Maven site](http://code.citytechinc.com/cq-groovy-console) for full documentation.
