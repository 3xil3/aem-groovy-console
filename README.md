## Installation

1.  Install the console package (NOTE: if cURL is not installed, the package can be uploaded manually via Package Manager)

    a. If you already have the Groovy bundle installed in Felix:

        mvn install -P install-console,local-author

        mvn install -P install-groovy,install-console,local-author

Additional build profiles may be created in the project's pom.xml to support deployment to non-local CQ5 servers.

    getPage('/content/geometrixx').recurse { page ->
        println page.title + ' - ' + page.path
    }
